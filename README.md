# Kotlin-Robot
Internshala Kotlin Assignment:

Problem Statement:

In our day-to-day life, we come across various problems that can be solved with the help of
programming. We will try to solve a similar problem with the help of Kotlin programming and
your problem-solving skills.
For this assignment, we will try to automate the different morning tasks which most of us
perform before going to class in college. We will create a Robot which will perform these tasks
for us to simplify our lives.
Every day in the morning we need to complete some set of predefined tasks that remain
constant. We can list the generic tasks as below:
1. Ring the alarm on time
2. Make coffee
3. Heat the water to a suitable temperature
4. Pack your bag (Keep only appropriate books for the day)
5. Cook breakfast and lunch
6. Iron the clothes

From now on a Kotlin Robot will complete the above set of tasks for us.
